# HP-Solve-2023
Problem Statement:

Understanding customer sentiments about products is of utmost priority for any product company including HP.
Consumers are more vocal on social media platforms and expressing their feedback and experience about any
product. HP too need to know consumer sentiments first-hand so that it can make better products with great user
experience and resolve customer issue faster. We need a one stop knowledge store, which can store reviews,
suggestions, complaint and sentiments for all HP consumer printers. This will help HP understand the consumers
better and improve brand value and NPS score.

Outcome:

The solution should be able to crawl social media platforms for posts talking about HP printers. It should be able to
classify/tag post with a printer brand or model, detect feature or problem the post is talking about and identify
sentiments (complaint, suggestion or appreciation).

The output should be in the form of a knowledge graph which can be queried by stakeholders for better customer
service, product improvement and faster resolution. The query can be like list all posts talking about wifi issue in
printer model X or brand Y.
